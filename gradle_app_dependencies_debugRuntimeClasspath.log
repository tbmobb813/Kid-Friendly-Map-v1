FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Directory '/workspaces/Kid-Friendly-Map-v1' does not contain a Gradle build.

A Gradle build's root directory should contain one of the possible settings files: settings.gradle, settings.gradle.kts, settings.gradle.dcl.It may also contain one of the possible build files: build.gradle, build.gradle.kts, build.gradle.dcl.

To create a new Gradle build in this directory run 'gradlew init'

For more information about the 'init' task, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/userguide/build_init_plugin.html in the Gradle documentation.

For more details on creating a Gradle build, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html in the Gradle documentation.
