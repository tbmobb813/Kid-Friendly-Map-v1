## 1. Agreement to Terms

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern access to and use of Kid-Friendly Map’s applications, websites, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By creating a guardian account or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you are accepting on behalf of a minor, you affirm that you are the child’s legal guardian and consent to their use of the Service.

## 2. Eligibility & Guardian Responsibilities

- Guardians must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in their jurisdiction) to create an account.
- Guardians are responsible for supervising child activity, managing permissions, and reviewing content.
- Guardians must maintain accurate contact information and promptly update consent preferences as needed.

## 3. Account Registration & Security

- Guardian accounts require email verification and may include optional multi-factor authentication.
- You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials and notifying us immediately of any unauthorized access.
- We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms or suspected misuse.

## 4. Acceptable Use Policy

Users agree not to:

- Share content that is harmful, harassing, or otherwise inappropriate for children.

Violations may result in warning notices, feature restrictions, or account termination.

## 5. Content & Intellectual Property

- Feedback submitted by guardians may be used to improve the Service without obligation or compensation.
- Guardians retain rights to user-generated content (e.g., custom categories) but grant us a sublicense to host and display it within the Service.

## 6. Offline Map Packages & Downloads

## 8. Monitoring & Analytics

- We use privacy-first analytics (e.g., Plausible) and error monitoring (Sentry) to maintain service quality.
- Guardians can opt in or out of optional analytics features via the parental dashboard.
- Monitoring tools are configured to minimize personal data collection, especially for child profiles.

## 9. Payment & Subscriptions (If Applicable)

- Some features may require paid subscriptions. Pricing and renewal terms will be disclosed at purchase.
- Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled before the billing period ends.

- We do not guarantee the accuracy of map data or AI suggestions and are not responsible for navigation errors.
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability is limited to direct damages up to the amount paid for the Service in the preceding 12 months.

## 12. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Kid-Friendly Map, its affiliates, and employees from any claims arising out of your misuse of the Service, violation of these Terms, or infringement of third-party rights.

## 13. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

- These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Oregon, USA, excluding conflict of law rules.
- Disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration in Multnomah County, Oregon, unless prohibited by local law.
- Guardians may pursue claims in small-claims court where jurisdictionally permitted.

## 14. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms to reflect product improvements or legal requirements. Guardians will receive notice (email + in-app) at least 30 days before changes take effect. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
