## Workstream Details

### 1. Legal Counsel Engagement

- **Tasks**

  - Assemble product brief (data flows, parental consent UX, retention defaults).

  - Shortlist 3 specialist firms; collect scope & budget (<$12k target).

  - Schedule kickoff workshop (60 min) covering COPPA nuances, cross-border transfers, breach response.

- **Dependencies**: Updated DPIA draft, data inventory spreadsheet.

- **Outputs**: Signed engagement, action list of required product changes, meeting notes.

### 2. Privacy Policy Drafting

- **Tasks**

  - Start from counsel template; tailor kid-facing disclosures, guardian contact channels, analytics vendor list.

  - Capture data minimization rationale for location, AI assistant transcripts, offline caches.

  - Run internal review (Engineering check for accuracy; Marketing check for tone) before legal sign-off.

- **Outputs**: `docs/privacy-policy.md` draft, revision log, translation plan (ES/FR next).

### 3. Terms of Service

- **Tasks**

  - Define acceptable use, guardianship responsibilities, arbitration locale, licensing for map/AI assets.

  - Align with app store policy and include COPPA-compliant consent language.

  - Add change-management clause for AI feature updates.

- **Outputs**: `docs/terms-of-service.md` draft, version control with semantic versioning (v0.8 now).

### 4. Data-Handling Controls

- **Tasks**

  - Build actionable checklist (collection, storage, retention, access, deletion) tied to release cycle.

  - Map each data element to lawful basis and retention window.

  - Integrate checklist into QA exit criteria and CI gates (manual for now).

- **Outputs**: `docs/data-handling-checklist.md`, Jira template for "Privacy Review" stories.

### 5. Monitoring & Analytics

- **Tasks**

  - Finalize Sentry wiring (Expo + backend) with sanitized context.

  - Deploy Plausible (EU region) with event catalog; expose opt-out in parental controls.

  - Publish `docs/monitoring-runbook.md` covering alerts, dashboards, on-call rotation.

- **Quality Gates**: Crash-free users > 99%; analytics retention <= 12 months; privacy toggle unit tests.

### 6. Offline Map Tiles

- **Tasks**

  - Week 5 spike: compare Native SDK vs Enhanced WebView caching vs hybrid approach.

  - Score options (func coverage, bundle size, privacy, maintenance) and pick.

  - Weeks 7-8: implement MVP offline UX, with encryption and guardian-managed download quotas.

- **Outputs**: Decision doc, implementation tickets, QA scripts for airplane mode testing.
