## 🧠 AI Features

### 1. Smart Route Types

| Route Type | Priority   | Best For              | AI Weight               |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 🛡️ Safest  | Safety 50% | Evening, young kids   | Safe zones, lighting    |
| ⚡ Fastest | Speed 45%  | Time-sensitive trips  | Direct paths, express   |
| 😊 Easiest | Ease 45%   | Strollers, tired kids | Less walking, elevators |
| 🌳 Scenic  | Balanced   | Pleasant weather, fun | Parks, landmarks        |

### 2. AI Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
Score = (
  Safety × 40% +
  Speed × 25% +
  Ease × 20% +
  User Preference × 15%
) + Context Bonuses
```

**Safety Score (0-100)**:

- Safe zone coverage (30%)
- Lighting quality (25%)
- Pedestrian density (20%)
- Traffic danger (15%)
- Emergency access (10%)

**Speed Score (0-100)**:

- Travel time (40%)
- Transfer count (30%)
- Walking distance (20%)
- Wait times (10%)

**Ease Score (0-100)**:

- Walking distance (35%)
- Transfer complexity (30%)
- Accessibility features (25%)
- Rest availability (10%)

### 3. Learning Model

**How it learns**:

1. Records every route selection
2. Analyzes patterns (time of day, weather, day type)
3. Adjusts future recommendations
4. Provides personalized insights

**Example learned patterns**:

```typescript
{
  morningPreference: 'fastest',    // User prefers speed at 8am
  eveningPreference: 'safest',     // Safety priority at 6pm
  weekendPreference: 'scenic',     // Scenic routes on Saturday
  rainyDayPreference: 'easiest'    // Indoor routes when raining
}
```

### 4. Context Awareness

**Factors considered**:

- **Time of Day**: Morning rush, afternoon, evening safety
- **Day of Week**: School days vs weekends vs holidays
- **Weather**: Rain, temperature, outdoor comfort
- **Traffic**: Rush hour patterns
- **User History**: Past choices and patterns
