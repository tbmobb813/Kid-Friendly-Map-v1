---

## 📦 Quick Start

### View Smart Navigation Demo

```typescript
import SmartNavigationScreen from './components/SmartNavigationScreen';

export default function App() {
  return <SmartNavigationScreen />;
}
```

### Generate AI Routes Programmatically

```typescript
import { aiRouteEngine } from './utils/aiRouteEngine';

// Generate smart routes
const routes = await aiRouteEngine.generateSmartRoutes(
  currentLocation,
  destination
);

// Update preferences
aiRouteEngine.updatePreferences({
  childAge: 10,
  timePreference: 'safety',
  maxWalkingDistance: 1000,
});

// Get personalized recommendations
const recommendations = aiRouteEngine.getPersonalizedRecommendations();
```

### Use Voice Guidance

```typescript
import { voiceManager, speakNavigation } from './utils/voice';

// Navigation announcement
await speakNavigation('Turn left at the next corner');

// Safety reminder
await voiceManager.speak('Remember to look both ways!');
```

### Display Map with Routes

```typescript
import KidFriendlyMap from './components/KidFriendlyMap';

<KidFriendlyMap
  route={routePoints}
  safeZones={safeZones}
  enableVoiceGuidance={true}
  onSafeZoneEnter={(zone) => console.log('Entered', zone.name)}
/>
```

## 🎯 AI Route Types

### 🛡️ Safest Route

- Maximum safe zone coverage

- Well-lit streets

- Lower pedestrian risk

- More checkpoints

### ⚡ Fastest Route

- Shortest travel time

- Direct paths

- Minimal transfers

- Express options

### 😊 Easiest Route

- Less walking

- Elevator availability

- Fewer transfers

- Flat terrain

### 🌳 Scenic Route

- Parks and green spaces

- Interesting landmarks

- Educational stops

- Fun activities

---

## 🧠 How AI Works

### Learning Model

``` text
User selects route → AI records choice + context
    ↓
Pattern recognition after 5+ similar choices
    ↓
AI learns preferences (e.g., "prefers safe routes in morning")
    ↓
Future recommendations adapt with bonus scores
    ↓
Personalized insights: "Based on your history..."
```

### Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
Total Score = (
  Safety × 40% +
  Speed × 25% +
  Ease × 20% +
  User Preference × 15%
) + Context Bonuses
```

### Context Awareness

- **Time of Day**: Morning/afternoon/evening/night

- **Day Type**: Weekday/weekend/holiday

- **Weather**: Clear/rain/snow/cloudy

- **Traffic**: Rush hour patterns

// Set preferences for 8-year-old child
aiRouteEngine.updatePreferences({
  childAge: 8,
  timePreference: 'safety',
  maxWalkingDistance: 800,
});

// Generate routes
const routes = await aiRouteEngine.generateSmartRoutes(home, museum);

// AI recommends: Safest Route with 95/100 score
// "This route passes through 3 safe zones and is well-lit"
```

### School Commute

```typescript
// Morning route
const morningRoutes = await aiRouteEngine.generateSmartRoutes(home, school);
// AI learns: User prefers fastest route at 8am

// After school
const afternoonRoutes = await aiRouteEngine.generateSmartRoutes(school, home);
// AI recommends: Scenic route (more relaxed time, nice weather)
```

### Weekend Adventure

```typescript
// Saturday trip to park
const routes = await aiRouteEngine.generateSmartRoutes(home, park);
// AI suggests: Scenic Route with parks and landmarks
// "Perfect day for an adventure! This route has a playground along the way."
