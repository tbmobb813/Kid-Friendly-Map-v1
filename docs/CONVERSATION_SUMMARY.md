## 📋 What We Discussed

We conducted a comprehensive strategic review of KidMap across three key dimensions:

### 1. Development Roadmap Alignment

Compared your app against a detailed phase-by-phase development roadmap for child navigation apps, covering research, concept development, MVP planning, development approach, and key priorities.

### 2. Market Gap Analysis

Evaluated KidMap against current market landscape ($1.65B → $16.18B by 2033), competitor positioning (Findmykids, Kaspersky, AngelSense, etc.), and identified unmet market needs.

### 3. Technology Stack Evaluation

Assessed your technical implementation against industry recommendations for React Native + Expo, backend architecture, database choices, and DevOps practices.

### What Could Go Wrong (And How to Mitigate)

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Research shows poor fit | Low | Comprehensive research with diverse participants |
| Compliance issues | Medium | Early lawyer engagement, privacy-by-design |
| Backend delays | Medium | Experienced engineer, clear specs, reduce scope if needed |
| Recruitment shortfall | Medium | Partnership pipeline, incentives, early outreach |
