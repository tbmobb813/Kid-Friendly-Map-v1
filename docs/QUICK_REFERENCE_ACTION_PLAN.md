## ðŸ†˜ Quick Answers to Common Questions

**Q: Is the app ready to launch?**  
A: Technically yes, strategically no. Need user research validation and compliance docs first.

**Q: What's our biggest competitive advantage?**  
A: Educational focus + progressive independence. We teach, not just track.

**Q: What's the critical path to beta?**  
A: Research sprint â†’ Compliance docs â†’ Backend service â†’ Beta recruitment.

**Q: Do we need a backend immediately?**  
A: Not for core functionality, but needed for multi-device sync and family accounts.

**Q: What about privacy concerns?**  
A: Local-first architecture addresses most concerns; need formal COPPA/GDPR docs.

**Q: Should we add social features?**  
A: Wait for user research validation; if yes, start with trusted family circles only.

**Q: How do we compete with established tracking apps?**  
A: Position as education tool, not surveillance tool. Parents want kids to learn independence.

**Q: What's the monetization strategy?**
