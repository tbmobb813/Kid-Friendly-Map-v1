# Monitoring & Analytics Runbook (Draft)

**Last updated:** 2025-10-01

## Overview

This runbook describes how Kid-Friendly Map monitors reliability, privacy-first analytics, and production health across mobile, web, and backend services.

## Tooling Summary

| Capability | Primary Tool | Backup / Notes |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Error tracking | Sentry (expo + backend) | Console logs with redacted stack traces |
| Performance metrics | Expo performance API, custom monitors | Pending Prometheus/Grafana integration |
| Analytics | Plausible (EU region) | Redshift aggregate exports (monthly) |
| Backend health | `/status` endpoints + heartbeat checks | Manual verification via runbooks |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Project-specific DSN issued by Sentry |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | `development`, `staging`, or `production` |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE` | Git SHA or semantic app version |
| `PLAUSIBLE_API_KEY` | Server access for event forwarding |
| `PLAUSIBLE_SITE_ID` | Domain/app identifier (e.g., `app.kidfriendlymap.example`) |

Store secrets in EAS environment configs and backend secret manager. Never commit DSNs or API keys to source control.

## Setup Checklist

1. Configure Sentry native modules via `@sentry/react-native` and ensure source maps upload during EAS builds.
2. Register Plausible site (EU data center) and set retention to 12 months.
3. Implement opt-in toggles in parental dashboard; default analytics to disabled until consent recorded.
4. Add heartbeat monitors for AI assistant latency, map tile delivery, and backend job queues.
5. Update CI to run monitoring unit tests (`__tests__/monitoring.test.ts`).

## Onboarding & Dashboards

- Sentry dashboards: Crash-free users, top issues, release comparisons.
- Plausible dashboards: Daily active guardians, session duration, feature adoption.
- Status page: Publish real-time uptime (private initially, on-call only).

Provide read-only access to Product, Support, and Legal for transparency.

## Alert Policies

| Alert | Threshold | Channel | Playbook |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Crash-free rate drop | <99% over 30 min | Pager + Slack `#alerts` | Investigate latest release, compare stack traces |
| API latency spike | p95 > 1.5s for 15 min | Pager + Slack | Check backend health endpoints, scale workers |
| Offline tile failures | >5% download errors in 1 hr | Slack mention Mobile lead | Inspect CDN logs, verify storage quotas |
| Plausible opt-out anomalies | Opt-outs > opt-ins in 24 hr | Slack `#privacy` | Review consent flow, confirm bug vs real trend |

Escalation: If P0 unresolved after 30 min, notify CTO and Legal if user data risk present.

## Incident Response Steps

1. Triage alert severity (P0â€“P3) and acknowledge within 5 minutes.
2. Assign incident commander (on-call engineer) and scribe.
3. Communicate status updates in Slack `#incident-room` every 15 minutes.
4. Engage Legal/Privacy if issue involves personal data exposure.
5. Publish post-incident report within 48 hours; include remediation tasks and privacy impact review.

## Privacy Considerations

- Redact user identifiers before sending to Sentry using `beforeSend` hooks.
- Configure Plausible in cookieless mode with no local storage.
- Log consent state changes and analytics opt-in/out events for auditing.
- Retain raw logs no longer than 30 days; aggregate metrics only beyond that.

## Testing & Verification

- Run synthetic error injection weekly to confirm Sentry ingestion.
- Execute Plausible event smoke test (trigger sample events) after each release.
- Validate parental opt-out by toggling setting and confirming events cease within 5 minutes.
- Track test cases in `__tests__/monitoring.test.ts` and update when instrumentation changes.

## Change Management

- Document monitoring configuration changes in CHANGELOG.
- For new alerts, attach runbook entry and test evidence before enabling.
- Legal review required if tooling begins collecting new categories of data.
