Top-level summary (production readiness)

Project is functionally rich and has tests, build script, and CI pipeline defined.
But several production-critical artifacts and processes are missing or incomplete. Below is a prioritized checklist with concrete actions, files to add/update, and rationale.
High-priority items (must-have before release)

App assets and store metadata

Missing/unclear: app icons, adaptive icons, splash assets referenced in app.json (e.g., ./assets/images/icon.png). I could not find an assets/ folder.
Action:
Add assets: icons (iOS/Android), adaptive icons, splash images, notification icons, favicon.
Add assets folder and ensure paths in app.json are correct.
Why: App stores and Expo builds require these assets; missing assets cause build failure or store rejections.
Estimated effort: small → medium (collect/design assets).
App signing / store credentials (iOS & Android)

Missing: eas.json, GoogleService-Info.plist, google-services.json, keystore, App Store Connect / Google Play credentials, and Fastlane config.
Action:
Create eas.json for EAS builds and set up credentials; store signing keys in secure secrets manager (GH Secrets / EAS secrets).
Prepare Play Store signing key (upload to Google Play) and Apple provisioning profiles & certificates.
Optionally add fastlane/ if you want fastlane automation.
Why: Required to produce signed release binaries and publish to stores.
Estimated effort: medium → large (account setup + key management).
Environment and secrets management

Missing: .env / .env.example or secret handling described. CI workflow references installs but not secrets.
Action:
Add .env.example with required keys (e.g., API_URL, SENTRY_DSN, GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, ANALYTICS_KEY).
Document which keys are required in README and add CI repo secrets mapping (GitHub Actions secrets).
Why: Prevents accidental secret leaks and ensures consistent environments.
Estimated effort: small.
Crash reporting / monitoring (Sentry / Bugsnag / Firebase Crashlytics)

Missing: integration and configuration for crash reporting.
Action:
Integrate Sentry (or chosen tool) and add config/instrumentation.
Add DSN to secrets and CI env.
Why: Critical for monitoring production errors, especially for safety features.
Estimated effort: small → medium.
Push notifications / Notifications config

Partial presence: expo-notifications in app.json plugins, but push certificates/tokens and server key not present.
Action:
Configure push notification credentials for Apple and Google and add server key to backend or notification provider.
Add documentation for dev/test flows (TestFlight, internal track).
Why: Push notifications require platform keys to be functional.
Estimated effort: medium.
App Store metadata, screenshots, privacy policy

Missing: App store descriptions, screenshots, marketing assets, privacy policy link.
Action:
Create store listing copy and localized screenshots, privacy policy page (host or link).
Why: App stores require privacy policy and polished listing for publish.
Estimated effort: small → medium.
CI/CD and build pipeline polish

Observations: CI config exists (ci.yml) and references Bun and multiple jobs. A few issues:
CI uses bun install and bun audit. Local machine may use npm; decide standard package manager.
ci.yml runs platform matrix but some jobs call test files that may not exist (e.g., tests/errorHandling.test.ts). Confirm test coverage.
Action:
Standardize on package manager (Bun or npm/yarn) and ensure lockfile consistency.
Add secrets to GH Actions and configure EAS secrets for builds.
Add build publishing step (EAS submit or fastlane).
Why: Reliable reproducible builds and releases require consistent tooling in CI.
Estimated effort: small → medium.
Medium-priority items (recommended before stable release) 8) Infrastructure & backend readiness

Items to check:
Production API endpoints, auth, rate limits, CORS, and billing for third-party APIs.
Migrations, databases, and backup strategies.
Action:
Define backend deployment plan; add config for production API URLs and health checks.
Why: The app depends on backend reliability.
Estimated effort: medium → large.
Security & compliance

Missing: dedicated security checks beyond CI audit.
Action:
Add SCA (software composition analysis) and security scans (e.g., dependabot, OSS scan).
Include privacy/data retention docs due to safety/children context (COPPA/GDPR considerations).
Why: Required for store review and trust; necessary because the app deals with minors / safety features.
Estimated effort: medium.
End-to-end tests and device testing

Current: unit tests present.
Action:
Add E2E tests with Detox / Playwright / Appium for critical user flows (check-in, safe zone, emergency contact).
Add device matrix runs (emulators, real devices) in CI or manual test plan documented in TESTING_GUIDE.md.
Why: Safety features require integration tests on real devices.
Estimated effort: medium → large.
Performance budgets, accessibility audit, and QA

Repo includes PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md and TESTING_GUIDE.md — good start.
Action:
Automate performance checks (bundle size, start time).
Run accessibility (a11y) audits and fix high-impact issues.
Why: Improve user experience and store acceptance; accessibility critical for families.
Estimated effort: small → medium.
Lower-priority / nice-to-have items 12) Documentation: README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE - Missing: top-level README and LICENSE (search found none). - Action: - Add README with quickstart, how to run tests, build, and deployment instructions. - Add CHANGELOG.md and choose a license (e.g., MIT). - Why: Developer onboarding and legal clarity. - Estimated effort: small.

Infrastructure and hosting for web

Missing: hosting config (Dockerfile, Netlify/Vercel config), domain config, SSL/cdn setup.
Action:
Add Dockerfile or GitHub Pages/Vercel deployment instructions; configure CI to publish web build.
Estimated effort: small → medium.
Analytics and feature flags

Missing: analytics configuration (Mixpanel/Amplitude/GA), feature flagging (optional).
Action:
Integrate analytics and link to environment variables and privacy policy.
Estimated effort: small.
Concrete files to add (suggested templates)

assets/
assets/images/icon.png, adaptive-icon.png, splash-icon.png, notification_icon.png, favicon.png
eas.json (example minimal)
Profiles for development and production; EAS build config
.env.example
API_URL=, SENTRY_DSN=, GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=, EAS_BUILD_SECRET=
fastlane/ (optional) or eas.json + EAS submit steps in CI
README.md (with commands below)
LICENSE (e.g., MIT)
.github/workflows/secret-setup-documented or README section for CI secrets
Sentry config file or small snippet in utils to initialize Sentry
Provide __mocks__ or test helpers if you plan to run tests in a Node environment (you already have a react-native mock).
Quick verification commands (what I ran and recommend)

Local checks (typecheck, tests, build script):

# Install dependencies (choose one and standardize)npm ci# TypeScript checknpx tsc --noEmit# Run unit tests (single test or all)npm test# Or run a single test file:npm test -- __tests__/safety.test.ts -i# Run the repository production build script (it exists: scripts/build-production.js)node scripts/build-production.js
Quality gates (minimum before publishing)

Typecheck: npx tsc --noEmit — must pass
Lint: run eslint with strict rules and fix issues
Unit tests: all passing
E2E: at least core flows passing on device/emulator
Build: successfully produce signed release (via EAS or native builds)
Security audit: SCA and dependency audit
Accessibility: fix major a11y issues
Monitoring: Sentry/Crashlytics working in production and test releases
Edge cases & gotchas I noticed (to watch for)

Mixed package managers: repo has bun.lock and package-lock.json and CI uses Bun; pick one to avoid inconsistent installs.
React Native Jest preset / transforms: running tests in a Node CI required the mocking/ts-jest approach — in RN build environments you should revert to RN preset and proper transforms.
Missing native configs (GoogleService-Info.plist / google-services.json) will break push/analytics builds.
Handling of user data & minors: privacy policy, data retention, and legal compliance must be explicit.
Secrets in CI: ensure signing keys and DSNs are stored only in secrets, never in repo.
Suggested immediate next steps (I can implement any of these)

Add .env.example and README.md (small, quick wins).
Create eas.json example and document steps to add App Store / Play credentials to CI (medium).
Add assets folder placeholders (icons/splash) and update app.json paths if necessary (small).
Integrate Sentry skeleton (small).
Standardize package manager (decide bun or npm) and update CI/workflow to match (small → medium).
